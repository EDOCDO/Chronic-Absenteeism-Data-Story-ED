    <meta property="og:description" content="Students who are chronically absent—meaning they miss at least 15 days of school in a year—are at serious risk of falling behind in school. Yet, for too long, this crisis in our nation’s public elementary and secondary schools has not been fully understood. Now, under the Every Student Succeeds Act, many states are reporting chronic absenteeism data annually. This data story, updated with the 2015–16 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), bolsters efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate chronic absenteeism so that all students have a better chance of reaching their full potential. The data from the CRCD is drawn from nearly every public school in the country and helps us understand who is chronically absent, at what grade levels chronic absenteeism tends to occur, and how chronic absenteeism compares community-by-community and state-by-state." />

                    Education can only fulfill its promise as the great equalizer&mdash;a force that can overcome differences in privilege and background&mdash;when we work to ensure that students are in school every day and receive the supports they need to learn and thrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, we know that many students experience tremendous adversity in their lives&mdash;including poverty, health challenges, community violence, and difficult family circumstances&mdash;that make it difficult for them to take advantage of the opportunity to learn at school.

                    Let's take a closer look at which groups of students were more likely to be chronically absent. Disparities in chronic absenteeism by key demographic characteristics are evident, though unacceptable levels of chronic absenteeism exist for all students.

                <p style="margin-top:1.5em;">
                    The disparities are striking. Consider the relative differences: compared to their white peers, American Indian and Pacific Islander students are over 50 percent more likely to lose three weeks of school or more, black students 40 percent more likely, and Hispanic students 17 percent more likely.

                    One notable trend: English learners, who face significant barriers in school and society, are approximately 1.2 times less likely to be chronically absent than their non-English learner peers. Fourteen percent of English learners are chronically absent compared to 16 percent of non-English learners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same is not true for students with disabilities who are 1.5 times more likely to be chronically absent than students without disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is intended to ensure all students with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate education yet chronic absenteeism is a barrier that gets in the way of achieving that goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At roughly 16 percent each, male and female students are similarly likely to be chronically absent.

                    Chronic absenteeism occurs at every grade level but is more prevalent in some grades than others. Chronic absenteeism rates are highest in high school, according to data in the 2015-16 Civil Rights Data Collection. Other research suggests that students in the early elementary grades <a href="http://www.nccp.org/publications/pdf/text_771.pdf" target="_blank">also experience high rates of chronic absenteeism</a>, which may be masked in analyses that are only available at the school level (as is the case here). Understanding when students are most at risk will help schools and advocates better target interventions to improve student outcomes.

                    Overall, more than 20 percent of students in high school are chronically absent compared with more than 14 percent of students in middle school. The chronic absenteeism rate was the lowest for elementary school students, at almost 14 percent. For more information on how we defined grade levels, <a href="#datanotes">see the data notes</a>.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5em;">
                    Next, we looked at how chronic absenteeism varied across grade levels for specific groups of students.

                <p style="margin-top:1.5em;">
                    For each subgroup of students there is a similar pattern: the likelihood of chronic absenteeism increases as students progress into high school. Notably, the stronger overall attendance observed among English learners dissipates over grade levels, such that they experience higher chronic absenteeism than their non-English learner peers when they reach high school.

                <h2 class="line">Why Chronic Absenteeism Matters: What the Research Says</h2>
                <p>
                    Chronic absenteeism is widespread&mdash;about one out of every six students missed three weeks or more of school in 2015-16. That translates to more than 100 million school days lost. Research suggests the reasons for chronic absenteeism are as varied as the challenges our students and families face&mdash;including <a href="http://new.every1graduates.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FINALChronicAbsenteeismReport_May16.pdf" target="_blank">poor health, limited transportation, and a lack of safety</a> &mdash; which can be particularly acute in disadvantaged communities and <a href="http://www.attendancecounts.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Ready-2010-2.pdf" target="_blank">areas of poverty</a>.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5em;">
                    Whatever its causes, chronic absenteeism can be devastating:

                        <p>
                            Children who are chronically absent in preschool, kindergarten, and first grade are <a href="https://ccsr.uchicago.edu/publications/preschool-attendance-chicago-public-schools-relationships-learning-outcomes-and-reasons" target="_blank">much less likely to read at grade level by the third grade</a>.

                <p>
                    The very students who tend to face significant challenges and need the most educational supports are often missing the most school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When our teachers, principals, policymakers, and others have access to robust data on the extent and nature of chronic absenteeism, we are all in a better position to provide students with the supports they need to stem this crisis in our schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2015 federal education law the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) empowered states to create unique statewide accountability systems. In addition to measurements of annual school performance, ESSA requires states to hold schools accountable for one measure of "school quality or student success (SQSS)" (ESSA 2015, 111-31) and <a href="https://www.future-ed.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TABLE_Chronic_Absenteeism_v2.pdf" target="_blank">36 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico submitted plans to the U.S. Department of Education to use chronic absenteeism as one SQSS indicator</a>. ESSA state plans outline strategies to <a href="https://www.future-ed.org/tapping-federal-dollars-to-reduce-chronic-absenteeism" target="_blank">leverage federal funds to improve attendance through teacher training, improving health services, family engagement, and school climate, important levers for increasing school attendance</a>.

                    Data included in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to certain data decisions. For the purposes of these analyses, schools with incomplete or inconsistent data values were excluded. Three percent of schools were excluded for the following reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The chronic absenteeism question was not applicable to the school (the school must have students enrolled in grades K&ndash;12).</li>
                    <li>The school reported incomplete data for enrollment and/or the chronic absenteeism count for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup.</li>
                    <li>The chronic absenteeism count was larger than the K-12 enrollment overall or for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup. Schools with partial or missing data for students with disabilities or English learners were included in all analyses except those that focused on these subgroups.</li>

                <h3 style="font-size: 15px;" class="line">Grade Level Definitions</h3>
                <p>
                    School grade levels were defined using the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) definition: elementary schools are those in which the lowest grade offered is PK through grade 3 and the highest is PK through grade 8, middle schools are those in which the lowest grade offered is grade 4 through grade 7 and the highest is grade 4 through grade 9, high schools are those in which the lowest grade offered is grade 7 through grade 12 and the highest is grade 12, other schools are those with any other configuration that does not fall within the previous three categories.

                <p>Data might be missing from the chronic absenteeism map if:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A district did not report chronic absenteeism data or the data were inconsistent.</li>
                    <li>A district that reported chronic absenteeism data did not match with the NCES district boundary file.</li>
                    <li>Twenty-five percent of district enrollment was in schools with incomplete or inconsistent data (see Data Exclusion Rules).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    District data displayed on the map may not be based on all schools in the district. All districts with data have complete and consistent data for at least 75 percent of their enrollment.

                <p>
                    The available district boundary information for some districts in Vermont reflects the boundaries of a supervisory union rather than a regular school district. As a result, the CRDC data for schools in 254 regular Vermont school districts were aggregated and mapped as part of one of 45 supervisory unions.
